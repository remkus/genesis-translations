##### I have your plugin activated but I don't see an options page

That's because there isn't any. If you have one of the provided languages properly configured in your `wp-config.php` file, then upon activation you should see all matters Genesis automagically translated.

Most likely you either have words hardcoded in your child theme's `functions.php` file or you're working with outdated (or incomplete) WordPress translation.
